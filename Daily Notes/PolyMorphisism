Ability to have more than one form.

It is of two types:

1.Compile time polymorphsim(Overloading, Same class)
2.Run time polymorphsim(Over riding,Different class)


Overloading:
Having same method name but the different parameters under a same class is called as Overloading


Overriding:
Having same method name with same  parameters under a different class is called as Overriding

When there is a same method with same parameters in both parent class and child class, the priority is given to the child class

if the user want to access the parent class method the we must use a relation 


Parent p =new child();

Now in this syntax, we will create the object to the child class, but reference is given to the parent class
