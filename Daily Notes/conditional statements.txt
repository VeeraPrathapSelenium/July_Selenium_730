Conditional Statements:

These statements are used to control the flow of execution based someconsition that is given by th user

For example, in a registration process only if the the regitration lable is displayed then only allow the user to register new user with proper details.

Now in this exmple, we need to verify wheter that the registration label is displayed or not .

Now here we take the help of conditional statments.

How many types of conditional statements are avialable in Java?

1.Simple if
2.if else
3.else if
4.switch case

1.Simple if:
Thsi statement is used to verify only one condition.
The body will execute only when the condition is true

if the condition is not true, then the body will never execute.

By default the condition is mapped to "true", so if the user need to validate any thing against the true , we really not required to provide the true word.

Syntax:

if(some condition)
{

}
