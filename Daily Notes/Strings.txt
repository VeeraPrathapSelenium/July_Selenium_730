Strings:


Strings is a combination of words, special characters, numbers including white spaces.

Strings must always represent in double quotes

Anything that is represented in double quotes it is called as a String

String has some set of methods 

1.length:
this method will return the length of a given source string

syntax:

Stringvariable (or) String.length

2.CharAt
this method is used to get the character from a specific index position

Syntax:Stringvariable (or) String.charAt(index)

Return type:Character


How to verify if the Given Character is WhiteSpace?
Character.isWhitespace()

This method will verify the given character is white space or not.

It will return boolean value.


Replace:
This method is used to replace the find value with user given value

Syntax:

String or String variable.replace("Find value","UserGiven Value");

Trim:

This method is used to remove the spaces which are in leading and trailing

Syntax:

String or String variable.trim()

Return type:String

Note :This method will not remove the space in between the words.


equals:

This method is used to compare two strings
This method will return true/false

Synatx:String or String variable.equals("Another String")

Return type:boolean

Note:If words are same but cases are different, As java is a case sensitive language, it will not compare


equalsIgnoreCase:

This method is used to compare two strings, by ignoring their cases
This method will return true/false

Synatx:String or String variable.equalsIgnoreCase("Another String")

Return type:boolean

ToUpperCase:

This method is used to convert the source string into uppercase

Syntax:String.toUpperCase();
ReturnType:String



ToLowerCase:

This method is used to convert the source string into lowercase

Syntax:String.toLowerCase();
ReturnType:String


How to verify if the given character is number or not?

Character.isDigit('character')

Substring:

This method is used to crop sequence of characters from the point where user given to the point where user is given

sysntax:

String.Substring(starting index,how many charcter do u need or length)

If the user is not specifying the length, then the compiler will crop the whole string from the starting point , that the user is specified.

indexOf:
This method is used to get the first index of a the given character in the source string
.

Syntax:
String or String variable.indexOf('character' or "String")

Return type:Integer


lastIndexOf:
This method is used to get the last index of a the given character in the source string


Syntax:
String or String variable.lastIndexOf('character' or "String")

Return type:Integer


StartsWith:
This method is used to verify that the given string is starting with with some word or not

Syntax:
String or String variable.startsWith('character' or "String")

Return type:boolean

EndsWith:
This method is used to verify that the given string is ending with with some word or not

Syntax:
String or String variable.endsWith('character' or "String")

Return type:boolean


Contains:
This method is used to search a word in the given source string

Syntax:
String or String variable.contains('character' or "String")

Return type:boolean
