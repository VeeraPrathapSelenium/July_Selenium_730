FileSystem is one of the important concept in every programming language.

This concept is used to handle different files and folder manipulations

In the real time, we come across some situations like, verify the summary reports or verifying the detail statements 

Download the file to a specific folder, if the folder is not exist , user must create that folder and download the file.

So to handle these scenarios we must aware of FileSystem.


When it comes to QA perspective we mainly depend on Excel,Note pad,PropertiesFiles  and Folder management for different purposes like storing daily to daily test results etc.


How to handle different Files?

In General we have two types of data

	* Character Data
	* Binary Data
	
The file with .txt as an extension is called character data

The file with other than .txt called as binary data

For every file type we have some readers and writers.



For Character data:
		Writers :
			FileWritter
			Buffered Writer
			Print Writer
		Readers:
			File Reader
			Buffered Reader

All the listed above are individual classes, which are available under a parent class called "File"

File f=new File("Filepath");

This above statement will never create a file


FileWritter,Buffered Writer can not be used , as it fails to write data for numerics and newline.If the user tries to write a numeric data , it writes the ASCII value of that character

To Over come this we will user Printer wiriter

PrintWriter will write the numeric data as well as new line too.

This print writer will always depend on File Writer.
