Inheritance:

Acquring the properties of parent class into the child class is called Inheritance

This reduces the line of code when we have a proper relationship between the classes.

There are different types inheritance avilable.

1.Single level 
2.Muti level
3.Hierarcial
4.Hybrid
5.Multiple


To get the relation between two classes "extends" key word must be used.

Single level:
Having only one relationship as a child from the parent class
Note: A Parent can not  extends a child.

Note: A child can change the properties of a parent when these is no final keyword available to that particular property

when we try to modify the properties when it has final keyword, user will get "The final field ParentClass.name cannot be assigned" as an error message
