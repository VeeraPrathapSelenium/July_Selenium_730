Arrays:

In General a varaiable can save only one value at a time.But if we need to save more than one value, variable is not a good options to do taht.

So to over come this, Arrays are introduced.
Arrays are collection of same datatype items.
Arrays are size based variable


Syntax:

Datatype[] somename=new Datatype[size]

All the element in an array will be at index based.
index will always starts with 0

To get the total elements in an array is "Size-1"

If the user requires to retrive a single item from an array, then user must call by its index value

When there is no index available specified by the user, then the compiler will throw an exception in run time as "Index out of bounds"

Can we print all the items from an array?

Yes this possible to do in two ways

1.Get the length of an array and use a for loop
2.Use For Each loop


How to get the length of an array?

Syntax:
arrayvariable.length

The above syntax will return a number, which is the size of an array


Note:By default arrays are homogenius.

To make an array as "hetrogenius"m then there is an called "Object Array"

This object Array can store different datatypes.
