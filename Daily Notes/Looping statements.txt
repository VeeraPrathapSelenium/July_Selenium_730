Looping statement"

The main purpose of looping statements is to iterate same statement with  different sets of data or to repeat same statement for a specific number of times.

in java we have different looping statements like

While
Do While
For Loop
Foreach 

While loop:
This loop is called as "idefinite" loop.
This loop will check the condition first, only if the condition is true then only it will allows us to execute the body of the loop

This loop will noty have any increment value.So user must give the increment value explicitly.

If there is no increment value or condition to be false, then this loop will run as indefinite loop with cloing.

Such kind of behaviours will lead into "Memory leaks" and the system will be corrupt.

So when the user is using the while loop, must be cautious in observing the increment factor or condition that goes false.

Syntax:

While(some condition)
{
//Body
}

Example : 
Print the output like 

Hello 1


Hello 2

Hello 3


Hello 10

DoWhile:
This loop is also a indefinite loop when there is no increment factor or false condition.

this loop will not check for the condition in the first go.
This loop will help the user to execute the body atleast once.

For loop:
This loop is called as "definite loop"
it will have a starting point and ending point.

Ending point shows , that how many times does the loop needs to be execute.here it does not requires to have increment factor to write explicitly.

Synatx:
For(starting point;condition;increment value)
{
//Body
}
